- The DevOps Approach
  -  Developers can produce software in short iterations
  -  A continuous delivery schedule of new features and bug fixes in rapid cycles
  -  Businesses can seize market opportunities
  -  Accelerated customer feedback into products


- DevOps Process
- Continuous Delivery, which is about delivering small, well-designed, high-quality, increments of software to customers. 
- Continuous Integration; creating packaged builds of the code changes released as immutable images; where immutable implies that when modifications are needed, the entire component is replaced with an upgraded version. 
- Continuous Deployment, which involves progressing each new packaged build through the deployment lifecycle as rapidly as possible. 
- Continuous Monitoring; with tools that help developers understand the performance and availability of their applications, even before they are deployed to production. 
- Delivery Pipeline; which is an automated sequence of steps that involves the stages of Ideation, Coding, Building, Deploying, Managing
- Continuous Improvement; which loops back to the Ideation phase in the delivery pipeline.
